# TripScript

A music visualization playground built with Javascript, HTML5 Audio, and Canvas.
I made it so I could experiment with music visualization without continuously recompiling the code, reloading the page, or restarting the music.

## Quick Start
1. Drag & Drop some audio files (mp3, ogg, or whatever) into the playlist on the Music tab.
1. Click on a song in the playlist to start the music.
1. Go to the Code tab and switch between visualization scripts using the dropdown ("Examples/Bars" is selected by default).
1. If you edit a script or create a new one, your changes will take effect when you click Save.
1. Read the Docs tab for more information.

## Notes

- Scripts are saved to your browser's LocalStorage. If you make something you want to keep, export it so it doesn't get lost.
- This code was originally written in 2014. I have not made any major changes since then.
- I have no real experience with audio analysis algorithms. The provided examples and utilities scripts are rather naive. My beat counter in particular is pretty bad.
